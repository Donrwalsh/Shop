## Populate Script

### Using
> `cd scripts/populate`
> `npx tsc`
> `node ./dist/populate.mjs`

### Current State
Some tools are available for connecting to mongoDB, but this script is most useful in producing data to import manually.

### TODO:
[] Is the current state of the database just the data or did I get the schema in there?
